# CI pipelines

Workflows in [.github/workflows](../.github/workflows). One watcher decides
*whether* to build; the reusable build job does the building; cleanup keeps
GitHub's limits; notify reports failures.

|---|---|---|---|
| [ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | CI | `schedule` (6 UTC crons: ~4 h windows with randomized minutes), `workflow_dispatch`, `workflow_call` | `ci` |
| [build.yml](../.github/workflows/build.yml) | Build | `workflow_call` (from `ci.yml`) | `build` |
| [cleanup.yml](../.github/workflows/cleanup.yml) | Cleanup | `workflow_call`, `workflow_dispatch` | `clean` |

Nothing here runs on `push` to `main`: a push changes
behaviour for the *next* scheduled run, it does not start a build.

The watcher's schedule is a set of 6 UTC crons, one per 4 h window (`0,4,8,12,16,20`),
each with its own randomized minute. GitHub's `schedule` trigger is best-effort —
under load a due run is enqueued late, and a tick that was missed is dropped rather
than back-filled (measured here at 3-4 runs a day against a 4 h cron, each 40 min to
3.5 h late) — so widening the window to 4 h trades redundancy away: a dropped tick
can now leave a gap of up to ~4 h instead of the ~2 h the earlier grid tolerated. The
watcher is idempotent, so an extra tick costs only the check steps unless something
actually moved. Spreading the minutes across each window takes ticks off the
contended :00 and keeps every run off the website's `23 */6` rebuild (no window
shares minute 23). Cadence is still not a guarantee — when a check must happen now,
`manual-ci.yml` is the path.

## The watcher (`ci.yml`)

One job, `check_patch`, decides everything downstream. Order matters because each
step's output is the next step's input:

| Step | Script | What it decides |
|---|---|---|
| Fetch configs & state | `fetch_data_branch.sh` | hard-fails if `data` is missing — no silent fallback to stale state |
| Compile Base Configs | `compile_patch_configs.py` | every app's pool membership from `configs/patches/*.toml` |
| Sync Patch Sources | `sync_patch_sources.py` | discovers all `(patches-source, host)` pairs, lists releases on GitHub/GitLab/Codeberg, rewrites `state/patch_sources.json`, prunes sources no config uses, emits `TRIGGER_STABLE`/`TRIGGER_BETA`/`TRIGGER_BLOCKED` and writes `changed_sources.json` |
| Fetch App Versions | `ci_fetch_app_versions.sh` | scrapes current store versions (honours `"_check_only_listed"` in `state/app_versions.json`) |
| Compare App Versions | `compare` step | `TRIGGER_APP_UPDATE` when a tracked app moved |
| Classify triggers | `ci_trigger_flags.sh` | the two questions everyone else asks: `SOURCES_CHANGED`, `ANYTHING_CHANGED` |
| Check Patch App Updates | `ci_check_app_patches.py` | only when `SOURCES_CHANGED`: downloads the changed bundles and hashes them (`state/patch_file_hashes.json`) to find which apps the new patches actually cover |
| Generate configs (JSON) | `ci_generate_configs.sh` | only when `ANYTHING_CHANGED`: writes the pool config each channel will build |
| Resolve effective triggers | `ci_resolve_triggers.sh` | per-channel `TRIGGER_*` **after** generation, and downgrades a trigger to 0 when the resulting pool has no enabled apps |
| Commit updated state | `commit_data_branch.sh` | pushes **only** `*.json` under `configs/` + `state/` to `data` |

Two design rules worth preserving:

- **`changed_sources.json` is written once**, by the sync step
  (`derive_source_changes.py`). Config generation, the patch-relevance scan and
  the trigger flags all project from that one record, so three steps can never
  disagree about what moved.
- **Generation is membership-only.** `ci_generate_configs.sh` sets
  `enabled = false` for apps outside this run's change set and never rewrites a
  version: an app whose `patches-version` is a channel keyword keeps the keyword,
  resolved at build time against `state/patch_sources.json`. Stamping a concrete
  tag into the pool config used to create a second artifact that had to agree
  with the state snapshot about what "stable" meant.
- The beta pool keeps one extra gate: an app-version bump alone pulls an app into
  beta only when one of its sources genuinely has `beta_date > stable_date`,
  otherwise the stable pool already covers it.

### What causes a build

| Event | Flags | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| A patch source publishes a release on the stable channel | `TRIGGER_STABLE` | stable pool regenerates and builds |
| …on the beta channel | `TRIGGER_BETA` | beta pool only |
| An app's own version changed in a tracked store | `TRIGGER_APP_UPDATE` | both pools reconsider membership (beta gated as above) |
| A source is blocked or unblocked (`404`/`451`/`403` from the forge) | `TRIGGER_BLOCKED` | regenerates membership, so frozen sources drop out and recovered ones return |
| Nothing moved | all `0` | no config write, no notification, no build |

A blocked source is **skipped**, not retried: neither a retry nor a live listing
recovers a repository that is gone, and the app reappears by itself once the
forge answers again. The deliberate fail-open inside that check is recorded in
[decisions/0003](decisions/0003-blocked-patch-sources-are-skipped.md).

### Ordering and safety rails

- `build_beta` runs first; `build_stable` `needs` it and additionally requires the
  watcher to have succeeded and beta not to have been cancelled. The single
  `build` concurrency group therefore serialises every manifest merge against the
  `website` branch — two builders never merge at once.
- `trigger_cleanup` runs on `always()` if either build succeeded.
- `ci_trigger_flags.sh` writes outputs with explicit `if` blocks rather than
  `[ … ] || [ … ] && var=` lists on purpose: under `set -e` a short-circuit list
  whose final command never runs exits non-zero and would kill the step *before*
  it wrote its outputs, silently turning every dependent step into a no-op.

## The build job (`build.yml`)

Called once per pool with `config_file` (and optional `remove_apks`). Everything
it needs to be reproducible lives in that one file, including the tuning knobs —
`PARALLEL_JOBS: "6"` and `UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY: "12"` are workflow env values, not
repo variables, so they are visible in PRs, survive forks, and carry git history
(why: [decisions/0005](decisions/0005-tuning-knobs-live-in-the-workflow.md)).

Step order, with the reason each is where it is:

1. Java 21 (Temurin) → checkout `main` with `fetch-depth: 0` and submodules (full
   history is needed to enumerate existing tags and to commit to other branches) →
   `fetch_data_branch.sh` (materialises `configs/` and `state/` directly from `data` branch).
2. `build_resolve_context.sh` maps the config file (`configs/<channel>/config.part*.json` or manual TOML) to `ARCHIVE_TAG`,
   `IS_PRERELEASE` and `TITLE_SUFFIX` — the single owner of
   "which channel is this run".
3. Bouncy Castle provider: Handled dynamically by `scripts/utils.sh` via `get_bcprov` whenever needed (for BKS keystores, apksigner, or BKS-to-PKCS12 conversions).
4. Keystore identity verification: In this fork, separate `install_keystore.sh` is removed and integrated directly into `scripts/utils.sh`. It resolves universal keystore variables (`KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `KEYSTORE_FILE`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD`, `KEYSTORE_ALIAS`), converting BKS to PKCS12 via `require_p12()` as needed. `build.sh` enforces `require_signing_identity` before any download starts.
5. `build_resolve_version.sh` computes `NEXT_VER_CODE` (`YY` + the next 4-digit
   sequence above the highest existing tag/release, e.g. `260141`).
6. Restore the Actions APK cache (`temp/apks`), optionally drop named APKs, then
   `pip install curl_cffi` for the store scrapers. The Cloudflare-bypass sidecar
   runs as a job `service` on `:8000`.
7. `scripts/build.sh <config>` — the engine ([build-engine.md](build-engine.md)).

   `UPLOAD_APKS_REPO` + `APKS_REPO_TOKEN` turn on the shared cache repo;
   `RVB_MORPHE_PASSTHROUGH` and the `RELEASE_NOTES_*_LINK` vars are passed here.
8. `update_usage_tracker.py` (`|| true`), `build_cache_cleanup.sh`, then the cache
   manifest (`size name` pairs) is hashed into the save key so a run that changed
   nothing does not re-upload 8 GB.
9. `build_get_output.sh` lifts `build.md` into a step output (and `build.tmp`,
   which the changelog step prefers as the source so the next build's `build.md`
   append does not corrupt it).
10. `build_make_manifest.py` → `temp/manifest/build.json`.
11. **Upload to release** (numbered): title `Build No. <code>`, body from
    `build.md`, `--prerelease` for beta.
12. **Update changelog and module update files**: `build_update_changelog.sh`
    checks out `update`, writes `changelogs/<code>.md` plus one JSON pointer per
    module zip, and lists the exact paths it created in `.updated_pointers`. The
    next step stages *those* paths explicitly — a `git add -A` on that branch
    would sweep in unrelated dirt. Runs only when modules were built.
13. `git checkout -f main` (dropping the `update` checkout) →
    `build_exclude_from_archive.sh` removes opted-out apps from `build/`.
14. **Upload to release (Archive)**: `continue-on-error: true`, assets only. It
    names no metadata at all, which is deliberate —
    [decisions/0001-release-metadata-ownership.md](decisions/0001-release-metadata-ownership.md).
15. `merge_archive_branch.sh` merges this build's manifest into the `website`
    branch. Must run **after** the archive upload so its live-asset filter sees the
    new files. Why manifests live on a branch at all:
    [decisions/0002](decisions/0002-manifests-live-on-a-branch.md).

## Cleanup (`cleanup.yml`)

1. `ophub/delete-releases-workflows` deletes releases and tags, keeping the newest
   **98** and anything matching the keyword `stable`/`beta` — that keyword list is
   the only thing protecting the archive releases from deletion.
2. `cleanup-archive-assets.py` prunes each archive to the **2 newest versions per
   app + architecture** (grouping by `<app>-<arch>.<ext>`, newest by `created_at`).
3. `cleanup_update_branch.sh` drops update pointers and changelogs whose release is
   gone; `cleanup_website_branch.sh` drops `manifests/<tag>.json` for deleted
   releases.
4. A `catalog-updated` `repository_dispatch` to `vars.WEBSITE_REPO`
   (default `sharath-5br2r-apps/sharath-5br2r-apps.github.io`), authenticated with
   `WEBSITE_DISPATCH_TOKEN` falling back to `APKS_REPO_TOKEN`. `continue-on-error`,
   because the site also rebuilds on its own schedule — a lost dispatch delays the
   catalogue, it does not break it.

## Required secrets and variables

| secret | `APKS_REPO_TOKEN` | build, cleanup | cross-repo write to `sharath-5br2r-apps/apks-dump`, doubles as dispatch token |
| secret | `CODEBERG_TOKEN` | watcher | raises Codeberg/Forgejo rate limits |

| var | `RVB_MORPHE_PASSTHROUGH` | build | bundle handling escape hatch |

## Log conventions

The Actions log is a product surface here: 60+ apps × several arches in parallel,
and a maintainer reads it on failure.

- `::group::` / `::endgroup::` wrap each build (in pooled mode the parent emits
  them while replaying a child's log, in completion order).
- Engine messages go through `pr` / `wpr` / `epr` (green `+`, `!`, red `-`) and
  `abort` for fatal ones.
- The asset uploader marks each file's progress with `⬆️` (start) and `✅`
  (uploaded), and reports a failed attempt as `::warning::Attempt n/3 failed for
  <file>` before the final `::error::` — so a scan of the log locates the failing
  file.
- `::warning::` and `::error::` are reserved for annotatable problems, and a
  validation rejection that must stop the job writes `::error::` **and** exits
  non-zero (see `IS_PRERELEASE` handling in the uploader).

## Testing a pipeline change

| Change | Cheapest honest verification |
|---|---|
| Engine functions (`utils.sh`) | `bash .github/traces/test_cache_helpers.sh` / `bash .github/traces/test_bundle_helpers.sh` — offline unit tests |
| A shell script CI calls | a stubbed-binary harness in `temp/` (see [contributing.md](contributing.md)) |
| Release/upload behaviour | the metadata matrix harness + a `workflow_dispatch` of Manual CI against `configs/config.manual.toml` |
| Watcher gating | Manual CI with a chosen config, or read the previous run's flags in the Actions UI |
| Website-facing formats | rebuild the site catalogue with `dry_run: true` on `rebuild-catalog.yml` |
