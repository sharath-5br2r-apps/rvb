# Configuration Guide

This builder compiles patched Android apps (APKs) and Magisk / KernelSU modules using declarative TOML configuration files.

Adding an app is as simple as defining a table with a download URL:

```toml
[YouTube]
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube"
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Single Quotes in Patch Names:** If a patch name contains a single quote, escape it by doubling the quote inside the string (e.g. `'Hide ''Get Music Premium'''`).

## Configuration Architecture

Configurations are organized in `configs/patches/*.toml` (e.g. `morphe.toml`, `anddea.toml`, `piko.toml`).

- **Single-File Co-existence:** All variants and builds for a patch source or patch identity can reside in one `.toml` file.
- **File-Level Defaults:** Any key defined before the first `[...]` table header acts as a default for all apps in that file. Apps automatically inherit these values unless explicitly overridden.
- **Dynamic Pool Routing:**
  - **Stable Only (Default):** Apps with `patches-version = "stable"` (or omitting `patches-version` in standard `*.toml` files) are compiled into the **stable** build pool.
  - **Beta Only:** Apps with `patches-version = "beta"` (or inside `*.beta.toml` / `*.dev.toml` files) are routed exclusively to the **beta** pool.
  - **Both Pools:** Setting `patches-version = "both"` (or `"all"`) compiles the app into **both** stable and beta pools.
- **Pinned Versions:** An explicit version tag (e.g. `v1.41.0`) routes to stable, unless the tag contains pre-release tokens (`beta`, `dev`, `alpha`, `rc`, `pre`) or the file default is beta.
- **Disabling an App:** Set `enabled = false` to disable an app across all build pools.

### `patches-version` Values

In a single configuration file, `patches-version` selects which patch channel
is downloaded:

- `stable`: download stable patches only.
- `beta`: download beta/pre-release patches only.
- `both`: download both stable and beta patches.
- An explicit release tag or version downloads that pinned patch release.

In CI, `stable` and `beta` produce their corresponding channel configuration,
while `both` is included in stable, beta, and combined build configuration
generation.

The setting can be written globally or inline for one app:

```toml
patches-version = "both"  # file-level default

[Some-App]
patches-version = "stable"  # app-level override
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Architecture Hard Requirement:**  
> A requested arch is a hard requirement: a build is produced only when a download actually carries that ABI (or is universal / has no native code at all). A wrong single ABI is rejected and the next source tried; if none supplies the arch, that channel is simply not built — never shipped under another arch's name. So an arm64-only app publishes only its arm64 artifact and no arm-v7a file, and the reverse. Universal bundles serve both channels from one fetch. (See [docs/decisions/0007](docs/decisions/0007-requested-arch-is-a-hard-requirement.md)).

## Naming, Branding & Filename Resolution

The builder enforces declarative naming conventions across artifact files, release notes, and the website catalog:

| Key | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `app-name` | Human-readable app name | `"YouTube"`, `"Instagram"`, `"Prime Video"` |
| `cli-type` | Low-level patcher type override | `"morphe"`, `"npatch"`, `"lspatch"`, `"apksigner"` |
| `engine-brand` | Optional metadata/branding override; inferred from `cli-type` when omitted | `"Morphe"`, `"NPatch"`, `"LSPatch"` |
| `patch-brand` | Canonical patch identity when using alternative engines | `"ReVanced"`, `"Piko"` |
| `variant` | Visual or feature distinction | `"Nord"`, `"Mocha"`, `"MaterialYou"` |
| `sub-variant` | Packaging / installation variation | `"clone"`, `"alt"` |
| `pkg-name` | Stock upstream package name | `"com.google.android.youtube"` |
| `patched-pkg-name` | Installed package name if changed by clone patches | `"app.rvx.android.youtube"` |

### Output Filename Convention

The engine automatically constructs clean kebab-cased filenames:

```
${app_slug}-${engine_brand_slug}-${patch_brand_slug}${variant:+-$variant}${sub_variant:+-$sub_variant}-v${version}-${arch}.apk
```

**Examples:**
- `app-name = "YouTube"`, `cli-type = "revanced"`, `engine-brand = "ReVanced"`, `patch-brand = "Advanced"`, `variant = "Nord"`
  ➔ `youtube-revanced-advanced-nord-v20.51.39-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "Instagram"`, `cli-type = "morphe"`, `engine-brand = "Morphe"`, `patch-brand = "Piko"`, `sub-variant = "clone"`
  ➔ `instagram-morphe-piko-clone-v439.0.0.37.89-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "TikTok"`, `cli-type = "morphe"`, `patch-brand = "Piko"`, `sub-variant = "alt"`
  ➔ `tiktok-morphe-piko-alt-v37.5.4-arm64-v8a.apk`

---

## Host Specification & Custom Instances

Both `patches-source-host` and `cli-source-host` support public forges as well as self-hosted git instances.

### Supported Syntaxes

1. **Standard Named Host:**
   ```toml
   patches-source-host = "github"   # https://github.com (default)
   patches-source-host = "gitlab"   # https://gitlab.com
   patches-source-host = "forgejo"  # (Requires custom domain or codeberg)
   patches-source-host = "codeberg" # https://codeberg.org
   patches-source-host = "none"     # Passthrough / local
   ```

2. **Custom Instance Syntax (`host_url|host_type`):**
   ```toml
   # Custom self-hosted Forgejo/Gitea instance
   patches-source-host = "https://git.example.com|forgejo"

   # Custom self-hosted GitLab instance
   patches-source-host = "https://gitlab.internal.company.com|gitlab"
   ```

3. **Direct Domain (Defaults to Forgejo):**
   ```toml
   patches-source-host = "codeberg.org"
   ```

---

## Patch Engines & CLI Modes

The builder supports multiple patch engines and CLI wrappers:

### 1. Morphe Desktop (Default)
```toml
cli-source = "MorpheApp/morphe-desktop"
cli-version = "stable"
```
Supports both `.mpp` patch bundles and classic `.jar` / `.rvp` formats with automated dependency resolution.

### 2. ReVanced CLI
```toml
cli-source = "ReVanced/revanced-cli"
cli-version = "stable"
patches-source = "ReVanced/revanced-patches"
```
Uses ReVanced CLI v4 / v5 argument structures, automatically handling `--patches`, `-b`, and custom aapt2 binaries on Android/Termux.

### 3. Xposed Modules (NPatch / LSPatch)
Inject Xposed modules directly into stock APKs without ReVanced patches:
```toml
[Discord]
cli-source = "JingMatrix/LSPatch"                         # or "7723mod/NPatch"
cli-version = "stable"
patches-source = "revenge-mod/revenge-xposed"           # the Xposed module is the "patches bundle"
patches-version = "stable"
version = "auto"
github-dlurl = "https://github.com/discord/releases/..."
patcher-args = "-l 2"
```

### Signing is handled for you, so never write it here

These tools sign their own output, so the engine passes your release identity to
them itself: `-k <store> <password> <alias> <password>`, where the store is the BKS
one for NPatch and the PKCS12 one for LSPatch (each can only read its own format).
Do **not** put `-k`, a keystore path or any password into `patcher-args`: the
configs are published to the public `data` branch, and the signing password would go
with them. If a build ever reports it cannot find a keystore, that is a CI secret or
a local environment configuration problem, not a config one
(see [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md)).

### `-l` means different things in the two tools

`patcher-args` is passed through verbatim, and the signature-bypass scale is not
shared between them, so a level copied from one tool's docs is a different setting
in the other:

| Tool | Levels | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| NPatch | `0` None, `1` Basic, `2` High, `3` Extreme, `4` Seccomp | `1` | `3` and `4` need manager mode and are rejected in embedded (`-m`) mode |
| LSPatch | `0` disable, `1` pm, `2` pm+openat, `3` +raw-syscall hooks | `0` | `3` patches native code, so an app that verifies its own code may notice it |

Omit `-l` to take the tool's own default. The same applies to `--injectdex`: it
puts the loader into the app's own dex list so that *isolated* sub-processes get
hooked, and it is an opt-in for modules that need those processes, not a fix for an
app that crashes on launch.

### 4. Instafel Patcher (Instagram Alpha)

You can natively build Instagram Alpha using the Instafel Patcher engine (`instafel/p-rel`) and Patcher Core (`instafel/pc-rel`).
```toml
[instagram-instafel]
cli-source = "instafel/p-rel"
patches-source = "instafel/pc-rel"
included-patches = "'unlock_developer_options' 'remove_ads' 'instafel'"
```

### 5. APKSigner (Sign-Only Mode)
Bypasses patching and signs the stock APK using the configured keystore:
```toml
[Stock-App]
cli-source = "apksigner"
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/..."
```

### 6. Passthrough Mode
Copies the downloaded stock APK directly without modification:
```toml
[Pure-Stock]
cli-source = "none"
patches-source-host = "none"
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/..."
```

---

## Patch Bundles & Selection

### Multi-Bundle Merging
Pass multiple patch bundles by supplying a quoted, space-separated list:

```toml
patches-source = "'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' 'other/patches'"
patches-source-host = "'github' 'gitlab'"
patches-version = "'latest' 'v1.2.3'"
```

### Bundle-Specific Patch Selection (`|` Delimiter)
When multiple patch bundles are loaded, use the pipe `|` delimiter to target bundles independently:

```toml
# Exclude Patch A in bundle 1, and Patch B in bundle 2:
excluded-patches = "'Patch A' | 'Patch B'"

# Skip bundle 1, include Patch X in bundle 2:
included-patches = "'' | 'Patch X'"
```
> [!NOTE]
> If no `|` delimiter is present, the patch list applies globally to all loaded bundles.

### Exclusive Patches Mode
- `exclusive-patches = true`: Excludes all patches by default; only `included-patches` will be applied.
- `exclusive-patches = "'jkennethcarino/adobo'"`: Makes only the specified bundle exclusive while retaining defaults for other bundles.

### Inclusive Patches Mode
- `inclusive-patches = true`: The mirror of `exclusive-patches`: `true` applies **every** patch the CLI lists for this app, so you curate downwards with `excluded-patches` instead of writing out dozens of `included-patches` names. Boolean only (no patch-source list), cannot be combined with `exclusive-patches`, and needs a tool that can list patches (Morphe/ReVanced - not Xposed modules or Instafel). "Every" is the package-filtered listing the builder already reads (`list-patches -f <pkg> -x`), so patches declaring no package are not included. Names are expanded at build time from the live listing: a patch the author adds later is picked up automatically, and since Morphe aborts when a patch fails, that automatic pickup can break a build with no change on your side. default: false

### Explicit Patch Folder (`patch-folder`)
Bypasses heuristic matching for repos containing patches for multiple applications:
```toml
patch-folder = "youtube"          # Strictly match patches inside the "youtube" folder
patch-folder = "ad backup geo"    # Match multiple folders
patch-folder = "*"                # Wildcard: maps every patch folder in the bundle
```

---

## Version Resolution & Architectures

### Target Versions (`version`)
- `"auto"`: Resolves the latest version supported by all selected patches (recommended).
- `"exp"`: Resolves the latest experimental version from patch metadata; falls back to `"latest"`.
- `"latest"`: Resolves the newest stable upstream version without checking patch compatibility.
- `"beta"`: Resolves the newest beta or alpha release.
- `"19.43.41"`: Pins to an exact application version.

### Target Version Code (`version-code`)
- `"auto"`: Auto-resolves the supported versionCode from patch metadata (e.g. Morphe Desktop).
- `"473623755"`: Explicit versionCode for APKMirror variant matching.
- Architecture-specific mapping:
  ```toml
  version-code = "arm64-v8a: 473623755 | armeabi-v7a: 473623748"
  ```

### Architecture (`arch`)
- `"both"`: Builds both `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a` (default).
- `"auto"`: Detects available architectures from upstream downloads.
- `"all"`: Universal architecture.
- Explicit: `"arm64-v8a"`, `"armeabi-v7a"`, `"x86_64"`, `"x86"`, or space-separated list (e.g. `"arm64-v8a x86_64"`).

---

## Download Sources (`dlurl`)

Every app must specify exactly one download source:

### 1. APKMirror (`apkmirror-dlurl`)
```toml
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube"
apkmirror-example-url = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-20-40-45-release/"
apkmirror-release-filter = "release" # Regex to filter release titles
version-filter = "^20\\."            # Regex to filter version numbers
prefer-dl-mode = "apk"               # "apk" or "bundle"
dpi = "320dpi nodpi auto"            # Screen DPI selection order
```

### 2. Uptodown (`uptodown-dlurl`)
```toml
uptodown-dlurl = "https://spotify.en.uptodown.com/android"
```

### 3. APKPure (`apkpure-dlurl`)
```toml
apkpure-dlurl = "https://apkpure.com/spotify-music-and-podcasts/com.spotify.music"
```

### 4. APKCombo (`apkcombo-dlurl`)
```toml
apkcombo-dlurl = "https://apkcombo.com/spotify/com.spotify.music"
```

### 5. GitHub Releases (`github-dlurl`)
```toml
github-dlurl = "https://github.com/owner/repo"
# Filter release tag or name:
github-release-regex = "^v[0-9]"
github-release-name-regex = "Stable"
# Match APK asset by architecture:
github-asset-regex = "arm64-v8a: 'MyApp-v{version}-arm64\\.apk' | armeabi-v7a: 'MyApp-v{version}-arm\\.apk'"
```

### 6. GitLab Releases (`gitlab-dlurl`)
```toml
gitlab-dlurl = "https://gitlab.com/owner/repo"
gitlab-release-regex = "^v[0-9]"
gitlab-regex = "MyApp-v{version}\\.apk"
```

### 7. Forgejo / Gitea / Codeberg (`forgejo-dlurl`)

forgejo-dlurl = "https://codeberg.org/owner/repo"
forgejo-release-regex = "^v[0-9]"
forgejo-regex = "MyApp-v{version}\\.apk"
```

### 8. Direct Download (`direct-dlurl`)
```toml
direct-dlurl = "https://example.com/downloads/com.example.app-1.0.0-all.apk"
```

### 9. Cache Repository (`cache_repo-dlurl`)
Fetches cached stock APKs from your dedicated assets repository (`$APKS_REPO`):
```toml
cache_repo-dlurl = "https://github.com/my-org/apks-cache/releases/tag/com.google.android.youtube"
```

### 10. Local File (`local-dlurl`)
Path to a local `.apk`, `.apks`, or `.xapk` file on disk:
```toml
local-dlurl = "/path/to/stock/com.google.android.youtube-20.40.45.apk"
```

### Extended Filtering & Source Verification

- **Signature Verification (`check-sig`):** Set `check-sig = true` to verify downloaded APK signature.
- **Preferred Mode (`prefer-dl-mode`):** `"apk"`, `"bundle"`, or `"auto"`.
- **Custom MicroG Patches (`custom-microg-patches`):** Supply custom microg patch list or `"'None'"` to bypass.
- **Patch/CLI Release Filters:**
  - `patches-source-filter` / `cli-source-filter`: Regex to filter asset download URLs.
  - `patches-tag-filter` / `cli-tag-filter`: Regex to filter release tags.
  - `patches-release-name-filter` / `cli-release-name-filter`: Regex to filter release titles.
- **GitLab & Forgejo Exclusion:**
  - `gitlab-dlurl-exclude-filter` / `forgejo-dlurl-exclude-filter`: Regex pattern to exclude unwanted release download URLs.

## Magisk / KernelSU Modules

The builder can package apps into Magisk / KernelSU root modules:

```toml
build-mode = "both"         # "apk", "module", or "both" (default: "apk")
include-stock = "merged"    # "merged" (includes stock APK inside module), "split", or "disable"
module-prop-name = "my-mod" # Custom module ID (default: "<app>-<author>")
compression-level = 9       # ZIP compression level (0-9)
enable-module-update = true # Generate -update.json and commit to update branch
```

---

## Local Execution (`build.sh`)

Detailed instructions for running builds locally on Linux or Android (Termux), including syntax, options, filters, environment variables, and pre-fetching versions, have been moved to [**`docs/local-build.md`**](docs/local-build.md).

### CI Variables and Secrets

The following values are consumed by `.github/scripts/*` and
`.github/workflows/*`. Configure ordinary values as GitHub **Variables** and
credentials or private material as GitHub **Secrets**. Secrets must never be
committed to TOML, JSON, workflow files, or build logs.

| Name | Type | Used by | Purpose / default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `APKS_REPO` | Variable | `build.yml` | Repository used for APK cache uploads. |
| `APKS_REPO_URL` | Variable | `build.yml`, download helpers | Cache repository URL; falls back to `APKS_REPO`. |
| `RVB_MORPHE_PASSTHROUGH` | Variable | `build.yml`, `utils.sh` | Enables Morphe bundle passthrough; defaults to `true`. |
| `UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY` | Variable | `build.yml` | Upload worker count; defaults to `4`. |
| `KEYSTORE_ALIAS` | Variable | `ci.yml`, `build.yml` | Signing key alias; defaults to `jhc`. |
| `RELEASE_NOTES_WEBSITE_LINK` | Variable | `build.yml` | Website link included in release notes. |
| `BATCH_CONFIG_PARTS` | Variable | `ci_generate_configs.sh` | Number of batch config fragments; defaults to `16`. |
| `FORCE_BATCH_CONFIGS` | Variable | `ci_generate_configs.sh` | Forces batch config generation. |
| `DISABLE_CONFIG_UPDATE` | Variable | `ci_generate_configs.sh` | Disables generated config updates. |
| `SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` | Variable | `ci_generate_configs.sh` | Skips app/patch version checks. |
| `CI_FETCH_ALLOWED_APPS` | Variable | `ci_fetch_app_versions.sh` | Limits version fetching to selected app names. |
| `CONFIG_FILES` / `CONFIG_DIR` | Variable | `ci_fetch_app_versions.sh` | Overrides the config file list or root config directory. |
| `NO_SLEEP` / `CI_FETCH_NO_SLEEP` | Variable | `ci_fetch_app_versions.sh` | Disables request throttling during local/CI fetching. |
| `CFB_URL` | Variable | `cf_get.py`, download helpers | Cloudflare Bypasser endpoint. |
| `TRAWL_URL` | Variable | `cf_get.py`, download helpers | Trawl endpoint. |
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Secret | `ci.yml`, `build.yml` | Base64-encoded signing keystore. |
| `KEYSTORE_FILE` | Secret | `build.yml` | Keystore file content/path supplied by CI. |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Secret | `ci.yml`, `build.yml` | Keystore password. |
| `KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD` | Secret | `ci.yml`, `build.yml` | Private-key password; falls back to `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`. |
| `APKS_REPO_TOKEN` | Secret | `build.yml` | Token for cache repository releases/uploads. |
| `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Secret | build and release workflows | GitHub API/release token fallback. |
| `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Secret / GitHub-provided | GitHub CLI/API actions | GitHub API authentication; `GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided by Actions. |

`GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, `GITHUB_SERVER_URL`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS`,
and `RUNNER_*` values are GitHub-provided runtime variables. They do not need
to be configured manually. The scripts also use local output paths such as
`FETCHED_APP_VERSIONS_FILE`, `APP_VERSIONS_FILE`, and `GITHUB_OUTPUT` when
running outside Actions.

## CI Workflow & Automation

### App Version Fetching

`.github/scripts/ci_fetch_app_versions.sh` reads enabled apps from
`configs/patches/*.toml`, queries their configured download sources, applies
the source and asset regex filters, and updates the tracked app-version data.
It supports GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo/Gitea, APKMirror, Uptodown, APKPure, and
APKCombo sources, while preserving unchanged versions when only selected apps
are requested.

GitHub Actions automates compilation, testing, and distribution:

1. **Config Compilation:** `.github/scripts/compile_patch_configs.py` parses `configs/patches/*.toml` and generates the stable, beta, and both configuration sets.
2. **Patch Change Inspection (`ci_check_app_patches.py`):**
   - Automatically detects new releases across GitHub, GitLab, and Forgejo/Gitea.
   - Computes granular checksums of patch bytecode per application.
   - Queues only the apps impacted by patch updates, preventing unnecessary rebuilds.
3. **App Version Tracking (`configs/app_versions.json`):**
   - Continuously scrapes APKMirror, Uptodown, and GitHub for new stock APK releases.
   - When a new version is detected, queues the app for build.
   - Adding `"_check_only_listed": true` limits checking to existing entries.

## Website Catalog & Metrics Synchronization

The builder maintains the web catalog published to GitHub Pages directly from the `gh-pages` branch:

- **Branch-Hosted Website & Manifests:** Release manifests are committed directly to `gh-pages:manifests/<tag>.json` and cumulative archive manifests to `gh-pages:manifests/archive/{stable,beta}.json`.
- **In-Repo Catalog Rebuilds:** External webhook dispatches and external website repositories have been eliminated. `.github/workflows/rebuild-catalog.yml` runs directly against the local tree on `gh-pages` and updates `data.json` and `data.json.gz`.
- **APKs Cache Repository (`$APKS_REPO`):** Dedicated assets repository configured via `APKS_REPO` using `APKS_REPO_TOKEN` (falling back to `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, then `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
